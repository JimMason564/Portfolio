This is my draft of my portfolio. As I get better at CSS, build more projects, and get into Javascript and back end programming I will continue to add on an build to this.

This portfolio is fairly basic- including live links to the various sections at the top, a responsive design built small to large, and a live link to the project I have completed. As the only assignment completed at this time is the refactoring project, I included a link to the Github page for the corrected code as opposed to the webpage as I cannot claim that work as my own. I wasn't sure if live links were required for my coming soon tasks so, as a huge baseball fan, one links to the live MLB scores page and the other to Driveline Baseball, a local company. These are not my sites but I wanted to make all tiles links as that seemed to be a requirement.
